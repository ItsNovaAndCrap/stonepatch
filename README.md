An open-source Minecraft mod with things I wanted in 1.17!


## Things this mod adds so far

**Rubies**
These gemstones can be crafted into anything! (feature will be added in a later update)

This repository is VERY incomplete! Expect it to be finished when the next version of Stonepatch releases!!
